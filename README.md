# IoT-Based-Automated-School-Bell-System-using-NodeMCU-and-Firebase
This project uses a NodeMCU 8266 and a single-channel relay module to automate a school bell system. The microcontroller connects to Wi-Fi, syncs the current time via NTP, and checks Firebase Realtime Database for scheduled period times. When the current time matches the period time, the bell rings automatically.
